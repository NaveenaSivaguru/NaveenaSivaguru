## Projects

### Two-Stage Deep Learning System for Breast Cancer Detection with Grad-CAM Visualization and Streamlit Deployment

A hierarchical deep learning framework for breast cancer detection from ultrasound images. In Stage 1, images are classified as Healthy, Abnormal, or Irrelevant. If Abnormal, Stage 2 further classifies the case into Benign, Malignant, or Unknown. The pipeline includes custom dataset preparation, preprocessing, Grad-CAM-based visual explanations for model transparency, and a Streamlit-based web app for easy deployment and real-time diagnosis support.

### Gallbladder Disease Identification

A custom Dual-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DB-DCNN) for automated diagnosis of gallbladder diseases from ultrasound images. The architecture combines a convolutional branch for capturing texture and spatial details with a morphological branch leveraging dilation and erosion for structural feature extraction. Feature fusion is performed using adaptive pooling to enhance discriminative power. To improve interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations are integrated, and the entire system is deployed via Streamlit, enabling real-time diagnostic support.

### Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

In this work analyzes employee attrition using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. Class imbalance was handled using SMOTE to improve performance. Multiple models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, ANN, and Logistic Regression were evaluated, with a custom hybrid model delivering enhanced results. SHAP values were applied to explain model decisions, highlighting key factors such as monthly income, overtime, and job satisfaction.

### Predicting Stock Market Index using LSTM and ARIMA

This project focuses on predicting next-day closing prices of stock market indices using real-world financial and macroeconomic data. Data was collected from online sources and included features like Unemployment Rate, USD/INR Exchange Rate, and VIX Index. Models such as Single-Layer LSTM, Multi-Layer LSTM, and ARIMA were implemented and compared. Feature engineering and preprocessing steps were applied to improve forecasting accuracy, and results were analyzed to identify the most effective approach for financial time series prediction.
